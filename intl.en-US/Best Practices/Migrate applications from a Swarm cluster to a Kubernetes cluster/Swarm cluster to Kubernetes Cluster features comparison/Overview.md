# Overview {#concept_m4j_5rd_ggb .concept}

This topic describes the prerequisites and limits for function comparisons between a Swarm cluster and a Kubernetes cluster that run in Container Service.

## Prerequisites {#section_fgg_lzd_ggb .section}

You have created a Kubernetes cluster. For more information, see [Create a Kubernetes cluster](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Kubernetes cluster/Cluster management/Create a Kubernetes cluster.md#).

**Note:** .

-   Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes supports the following clusters: the dedicated Kubernetes cluster, the managed Kubernetes cluster, the multi-zone Kubernetes cluster, and the serverless Kubernetes cluster \(in beta\).
-   The topic uses creating a Kubernetes cluster as an example to compare the functions between a Swarm and a Kubernetes cluster that run on Container Service.

## Limits {#section_a42_t22_ggb .section}

-   The applications used for the function comparison are as follows:
    -   Stateless applications
    -   Applications that use a data base or a storage device to store data
