# Create an application by using a private image repository

In many scenarios, you use an image in a private image repository to deploy an application. This topic describes how to create a private image repository in the Container Registry console and use an image in this repository to create an application.

## Create a private image repository

If this is the first time you use the Container Registry console, the Tips message appears, prompting you to set a password for logging on to the console. Click **Activate Now** and set a password.

1.  Log on to the [Container Registry console](https://cr.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the top navigation bar, select a region.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Instances**.

4.  On the Instances page, click the default instance.

5.  In the left-side navigation pane of the management page of the Container Registry Personal Edition instance, choose **Repository** \> **Repositories**.

6.  In the upper-left corner of the Repositories page, click **Create Repositories**.

7.  In the **Repository Info** step, set **Namespace**, **Repository Name**, **Summary**, and **Repository Type**. In this example, the private type is selected. Click **Next**.

8.  In the **Code Source** step, select **Local Repository** for Code Source and click **Create Repositories**.

    **Note:** In the repository list, click the name of the created repository. On the **Guide** tab of the **Details** page, you can view information about how to use the private image repository.

9.  Run the following command to log on to the image repository:

    **Note:**

    -   If you use an Alibaba Cloud account, the name of the Alibaba Cloud account is the username for logging on to the repository.
    -   If you use a Resource Access Management \(RAM\) user, the string before .onaliyun.com is the username for logging on to the repository. For example, if the name of your RAM user is 123@1880770869021234.onaliyun.com, the username for logging on to the repository is 123@1880770869021234.
    ```
    sudo docker login --username=<Repository username> registry.cn-<The region where the instance of Container Registry Personal Edition is deployed>.aliyuncs.com
    ```

    In the output, enter the password. If `login succeeded` is displayed, the logon is successful.

10. Run the following command to query the IDs of images in the repository:

    ```
    docker images     
    ```

11. Run the following command to add a tag to an image:

    ```
    sudo docker tag <Image ID> registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/<Namespace>/<Repository name>:[Image version]
    ```

12. Run the following command to push the image to the repository:

    ```
    sudo docker push registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/<Namespace>/<Repository name>:[Image version]
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```
    The push refers to a repository [registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/XXX/tomcat-private]

    ```

    Go to the repository details page. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tags**. Verify that the image is uploaded to the repository. You can also view the image version.


## Create a private repository logon Secret

To pull private images, you must use a **private repository logon Secret**.

1.  Log on to the [ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane of the ACK console, click **Clusters**.

3.  On the Clusters page, find the cluster that you want to manage and click the name of the cluster or click **Details** in the **Actions** column. The details page of the cluster appears.

4.  In the left-side navigation pane of the details page, choose **Configurations** \> **Secrets**.

5.  In the upper-right corner of the Secrets page, click **Create**.

6.  In the **Create** panel, set the parameters and click **OK**.

    |Parameter|Description|
    |---------|-----------|
    |Name|The name of the Secret.|
    |Type|The following types of Secret are supported:    -   Opaque: a regular Secret. Enter a key and a value. The value must be encoded in Base64.
    -   Private Repository Logon Secret: This type of Secret stores the credentials that are required to pull images from a private image repository. Enter the address, username, and password of the image repository.

**Note:** The username is the full name of your Alibaba Cloud account. The password is the one specified when you activated Container Registry. You can go to the **Access Credential** page to change the password.

    -   TLS Certificate: Use a Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) certificate to verify user identities.
        -   Cert: Enter the content of the TLS certificate.
        -   Key: Enter the private key of the TLS certificate. |

    After the Secret is created, you are redirected to the Secrets page. You can find the newly created Secret in the list.


**Note:**

You can also create a **private repository logon Secret** by using a CLI. For more information, see [t16645.md\#](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Cluster/Access clusters/Connect to ACK clusters by using kubectl.md).

## Create an application by using a private image repository

1.  Log on to the [ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane of the ACK console, click **Clusters**.

3.  On the Clusters page, find the cluster that you want to manage and click the name of the cluster or click **Details** in the **Actions** column. The details page of the cluster appears.

4.  In the left-side navigation pane of the details page, choose **Workloads** \> **Deployments**.

5.  On the **Deployments** page, click **Create from YAML** in the upper-right corner.

    **Note:** You can also click **Create from Image** to create an application. For more information, see [Create an application by using an image pull Secret](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Application management/Workloads/Create a stateless application by using a Deployment.md).

6.  Set **Sample Template** to **Custom** and copy the following content to the **Template** section.

    ```
    apiVersion: apps/v1 
    kind: Deployment 
    metadata: 
      name: private-image
      nameSpace: default  
      labels:  
        app: private-image  
    spec:   
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: private-image
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: private-image
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: private-image
            image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/The name of the namespace/tomcat-private:latest
            ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          imagePullSecrets:
          - name: regsecret
    ```

7.  Click **Create**.

    Go to the Deployments page. You can view the newly created application.
