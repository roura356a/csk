# Quick start

This topic describes how to get started with Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) in steps and provides answers to some frequently asked questions about ACK.

## Procedure

The following flowchart shows how to get started with ACK in steps.

![Flowchart for ACK](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/8558541061/p7176.png)

1.  Assign roles to your Alibaba Cloud account. For more information, see [ACK default roles](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Authorization management/ACK default roles.md).

    For more information about how to create a Resource Access Management \(RAM\) permission policy and assign role-based access control \(RBAC\) roles to a RAM user, see [Create a custom RAM policy](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Authorization management/Create a custom RAM policy.md) and [Assign RBAC roles to RAM users](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Authorization management/Assign RBAC roles to a RAM user.md).

2.  Create a standard managed Kubernetes cluster. For more information, see [Create a managed Kubernetes cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Cluster/Create Kubernetes clusters/Create a managed Kubernetes cluster.md).

## FAQ

-   **How do I create a Docker image for an application that runs on an ACK cluster?**

    Container Registry allows you to create a container image within a few clicks. For more information about how to create a Docker image for an application, see [Build an image for a Java application by using a Dockerfile with multi-stage builds](). You can also use the open source tool [Derrick](https://github.com/alibaba/derrick) to simplify how to containerize your application.

-   **If I cannot create an image, how do I deploy an application to an ACK cluster?**

    ACK allows you to create applications by using images of the following types: images stored in Container Registry, official images, favorite images, and public images. For more information, see [Deploy a stateless application from an image](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Basic operations/Deploy a stateless application from an image.md).

-   **How do I plan the network before I create a cluster?**

    Before you create a cluster, make sure that the CIDR block of the virtual private cloud \(VPC\) where you want to deploy the cluster, CIDR blocks of Services, and CIDR blocks of pods do not overlap. You can select an automatically created VPC. In this case, use the default IP addresses when you create a cluster. However, in some complex scenarios, you must plan the IP address of each Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instance, pod CIDR blocks, and Service CIDR blocks. For more information, see [Plan CIDR blocks for an ACK cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Network/Plan CIDR blocks for an ACK cluster.md).

-   **Which network plug-in should I choose when I create a cluster, Terway or Flannel?**

    Flannel is a simple and stable container network interface \(CNI\) plug-in developed by the Kubernetes community. However, Flannel provides only basic features and does not support standard Kubernetes network policies. Terway is a network plug-in developed by Alibaba Cloud. Terway supports standard Kubernetes network policies and bandwidth throttling on containers. Terway outperforms Flannel in terms of network performance. For more information, see [Use the Terway plug-in](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Network/Container network/Use the Terway plug-in.md).

-   **What can I do if I failed to create a cluster?**

    You can view the cluster logs for troubleshooting. For more information, see [Failed to create a Kubernetes cluster](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/148453.htm).

-   **How do I access Kubernetes workloads over the Internet?**

    ACK allows you to use the following methods to access workloads over the Internet:

    -   Access a node port.
    -   [Use a Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) instance](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Network/Service Management/Use an existing SLB instance to expose an application.md).
    -   [Nginx Ingress](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Network/Ingress management/Create an Ingress.md)
    -   [Use a Domain Name System \(DNS\) server](https://developer.aliyun.com/article/633412).
    -   Use a NAT gateway. The NAT gateway must have Destination Network Address Translation \(DNAT\) entries configured.
-   **If multiple workloads exist in a cluster, how can a workload be accessed by other workloads in the cluster?**

    To access a workload from other workloads in the same cluster, use the internal domain name or a ClusterIP Service.

    Assume that Workload A and Workload B exist in the same cluster. To allow Workload A to access Workload B, create a ClusterIP Service for Workload B. For more information, see [Manage Services](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Network/Service Management/Manage Services.md). After you create a ClusterIP Service, Workload A can access Workload B by using the following connect strings:

    -   `<The name of the ClusterIP Service>. <The namespace to which Workload B belongs>.svc.cluster.local:<Port number>`
    -   `ClusterIP:<Port number>`
-   **What are the considerations when I expose Services through SLB instances?**

    If you create a LoadBalancer Service, cloud controller manager \(CCM\) automatically creates and configures an SLB instance for the Service. We recommend that you do not configure the SLB instance in the SLB console. Otherwise, the Service may be unavailable. For more information, see [Considerations for configuring a LoadBalancer type Service](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Network/Service Management/Considerations for configuring a LoadBalancer type Service.md).

-   **How do I pull private images from Container Registry?**

    We recommend that you use the aliyun-acr-credential-helper component. By default, each cluster has aliyun-acr-credential-helper installed. You can use this component to pull private images from Container Registry without a password. For more information, see [Use aliyun-acr-credential-helper to pull images without a password](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Application management/Image/Use aliyun-acr-credential-helper to pull images without a password.md).
