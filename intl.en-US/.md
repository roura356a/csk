# FAQ

This topic provides answers to some frequently asked questions about Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\).

If you receive error messages returned by ACK, you can visit the [ACK API Error Center](https://error-center.aliyun.com/status/product/Cos?spm=5176.10421674.home.7.7e36ebed2QyP5P) to fix the errors. If you do not receive error messages, you can identify the causes of the errors and fix the errors based on the following scenarios.
