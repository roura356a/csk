# Billing {#concept_kjv_shc_5db .concept}

Container Service for Kubernetes includes Dedicated Kubernetes and Serverless Kubernetes.

-   Dedicated Kubernetes is the classic mode.
    1.  Currently, Container Service is free of charge. However, you have to pay for the resources you used, such as Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instances and Server Load Balancer instances.
    2.  In Container Service, the automatically created or manually added ECS instances and Server Load Balancer instances are billed according to the ECS and Server Load Balancer prices respectively. For more information, see [ECS billing method](../../../../reseller.en-US/Pricing/Pricing overview.md#) and [Pay-As-You-Go](../../../../reseller.en-US/Pricing/Pay-As-You-Go.md#).
-   Serverless Kubernetes is currently in the public test phase and is available for free.
