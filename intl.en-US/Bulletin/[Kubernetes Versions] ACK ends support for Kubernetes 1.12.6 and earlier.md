# \[Kubernetes Versions\] ACK ends support for Kubernetes 1.12.6 and earlier

Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) no longer supports Kubernetes 1.12.6 and earlier based on the support policy for Kubernetes versions. ACK also ends technical support for Kubernetes 1.12.6 and earlier. We recommend that you upgrade Kubernetes versions for your ACK clusters as soon as possible. For more information about how to upgrade a cluster, see [Upgrade a cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Cluster/Manage clusters/Upgrade a cluster.md).

For more information about the support policy for Kubernetes versions, see [t160315.md\#](/intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Kubernetes versions.md).
