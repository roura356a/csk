# \[Product Changes\] ACK ends support for Swarm

Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) will end technical support for Swarm at the end of 2019. We appreciate your support for Container Service for Swarm in the past years and will continue to provide more stable and reliable enterprise-class services with the support of ACK in the future. You can start to plan the migration of your services deployed in Container Service for Swarm clusters.

1.  Starting from July 1, 2019, Container Service for Swarm clusters can no longer be created in the console. If you need to create Container Service for Swarm clusters in the console, submit a ticket.
2.  Starting from December 31, 2019, the Container Service for Swarm documentation is removed and the Container Service for Swarm console is no longer in use. Technical support for Container Service for Swarm is also no longer provided. You can manage your Container Service for Swarm clusters by calling the API.

To help you migrate from Container Service for Swarm to ACK, we release a migration guide in the ACK documentation. For more information, see [t288258.md\#](/intl.en-US/Best Practices/Migrate applications from a Swarm cluster to a Kubernetes cluster/Overview.md). You can contact us if you have any questions.
