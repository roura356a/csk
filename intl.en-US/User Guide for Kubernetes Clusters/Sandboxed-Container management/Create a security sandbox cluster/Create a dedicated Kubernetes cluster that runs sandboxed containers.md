# Create a dedicated Kubernetes cluster that runs sandboxed containers

This topic describes how to create a dedicated Kubernetes cluster that runs sandboxed containers in the Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) console.

Related Alibaba Cloud services are activated. For more information, see [Quick start for first-time users](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Quick start for first-time users.md).

## Limits

-   Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) instances that are created along with an ACK cluster support only the pay-as-you-go billing method.
-   ACK clusters support only VPCs.
-   By default, each account has specific quotas on cloud resources that can be created. You cannot create clusters if the quota is reached. Make sure that you have sufficient resource quotas before you create a cluster. To request a quota increase, submit a ticket.
    -   By default, you can create at most five clusters across all regions with each account. Each cluster can contain at most 40 nodes. To increase the quota on the number of clusters or nodes that you can create,[submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/console.htm).

        **Note:** By default, you can add at most 48 route entries to the virtual private cloud \(VPC\) where an ACK cluster is deployed. This means that you can configure at most 48 route entries for an ACK cluster deployed in a VPC. To increase the quota on the number of route entries for a VPC,[submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/console.htm).

    -   By default, you can create up to 100 security groups with each account.
    -   By default, you can create up to 60 pay-as-you-go SLB instances with each account.
    -   By default, you can create up to 20 elastic IP addresses \(EIPs\) with each account.
-   To create an ACK cluster that runs sandboxed containers, you must set the parameters as described in the following table. Otherwise, the cluster cannot run sandboxed containers.

    |Parameter|Description|

5.  On the **Dedicated Kubernetes** tab, configure the cluster.

    1.  Configure basic settings of the cluster.

        |Parameter|Description|
        |---------|-----------|
        |**Cluster Name**|Enter a name for the ACK cluster.

**Note:** The name must be 1 to 63 characters in length, and can contain digits, letters, and hyphens \(-\). |
        |**Region**|Select a region to deploy the cluster. |
        |**Resource Group**|Move the pointer over **All Resources** at the top of the page and select the resource group that you want to use. After you select a resource group, virtual private clouds \(VPCs\) and vSwitches are filtered based on the selected resource group. When you create a cluster, only the VPCs and vSwitches that belong to the selected resource group are displayed in the console.

![Resource Groups](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9688404061/p127165.png) |
        |**Kubernetes Version**|Select a Kubernetes version.|
        |**Container Runtime**|Select **Sandboxed-Container**.|
        |**VPC**|Select a VPC to deploy the cluster. Standard VPCs and shared VPCs are supported.

        -   Shared VPC: The owner of a VPC \(resource owner\) can share the vSwitches in the VPC with other accounts in the same organization.
        -   Standard VPC: The owner of a VPC \(resource owner\) cannot share the vSwitches in the VPC with other accounts.
**Note:** ACK clusters support only VPCs. You can select a VPC from the drop-down list. If no VPC is available, click **Create VPC** to create one. For more information, see [Create a VPC](/intl.en-US/VPCs and vSwitchs/Work with VPCs.md). |
        |**VSwitch**|Select vSwitches.

You can select up to three vSwitches that are deployed in different **zones**. If no vSwitch is available, click **Create VSwitch** to create one. For more information, see [Create a vSwitch](/intl.en-US/VPCs and vSwitchs/Work with vSwitches.md). |
        |**Network Plug-in**|Select a network plug-in. Flannel and Terway are supported. For more information, see [Terway and Flannel](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Network/Container network/Use the Terway plug-in.md).

        -   Flannel: a simple and stable Container Network Interface \(CNI\) plug-in that is developed by open source Kubernetes. Flannel provides a few simple features. However, it does not support standard Kubernetes network policies.
        -   Terway: a network plug-in that is developed by ACK. Terway allows you to assign elastic network interfaces \(ENIs\) of Alibaba Cloud to containers. It also allows you to customize Kubernetes network policies to regulate how containers communicate with each other and implement bandwidth throttling on individual containers.

**Note:**

            -   The number of pods that can be deployed on a node depends on the number of ENIs that are attached to the node and the maximum number of secondary IP addresses that are provided by these ENIs.
            -   If you select a shared VPC for an ACK cluster, you must select Terway as the network plug-in.
            -   If you select **Terway**, an ENI is shared among multiple pods. A secondary IP address of the ENI is assigned to each pod. |
        |**IP Addresses per Node**|If you select **Flannel** as the network plug-in, you must set **IP Addresses per Node**.

**Note:**

        -   **IP Addresses per Node** specifies the maximum number of IP addresses that can be assigned to each node. We recommend that you use the default value.
        -   After you select the VPC and specify the number of IP addresses per node, recommended values are automatically generated for Pod CIDR block and Service CIDR block. The system also provides the maximum number of nodes that can be deployed in the cluster and the maximum number of pods that can be deployed on each node. You can modify the values based on your business requirements. |
        |**Pod CIDR Block**|If you select **Flannel** as the network plug-in, you must set **Pod CIDR Block**.

The CIDR block specified by **Pod CIDR Block** cannot overlap with that of the VPC or those of the existing clusters in the VPC. The CIDR block cannot be modified after the cluster is created. The Service CIDR block cannot overlap with the pod CIDR block. For more information about subnetting for ACK clusters, see [Plan CIDR blocks for an ACK cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Network/Plan CIDR blocks for an ACK cluster.md). |
        |**Pod VSwitch**|If you select Terway as the network plug-in, you must allocate vSwitches to pods. For each vSwitch that allocates IP addresses to worker nodes, you must select a vSwitch in the same zone to allocate IP addresses to pods.

The elastic network interface \(ENI\) used by a pod must be deployed in the zone where the node that hosts the pod is deployed. Therefore, you must select another vSwitch in the zone where the node vSwitch is deployed. This vSwitch assigns IP addresses to pods. To ensure sufficient IP addresses for all pods, we recommend that you set the mask length of the CIDR block to a value no greater than 19 for the vSwitch. |
        |**Service CIDR**|Set **Service CIDR**. The CIDR block specified by **Service CIDR** cannot overlap with that of the VPC or those of the existing clusters in the VPC. The CIDR block cannot be modified after the cluster is created. The Service CIDR block cannot overlap with the pod CIDR block. For more information about subnetting for ACK clusters, see [Plan CIDR blocks for an ACK cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Network/Plan CIDR blocks for an ACK cluster.md). |
        |**Configure SNAT**|By default, an ACK cluster cannot access the Internet. If the VPC that you select for the ACK cluster cannot access the Internet, you can select **Configure SNAT for VPC**. This way, ACK will create a NAT gateway and configure Source Network Address Translation \(SNAT\) rules to enable Internet access for the VPC. |
        |**Access to API Server**|By default, an internal-facing Server Load Balancer \(SLB\) instance is created for the cluster API server. You can modify the specification of the SLB instance. For more information, see [Instance types and specifications](/intl.en-US/Classic Load Balancer/User Guide/Instance/SLB instance overview.md).

**Note:** If you delete the SLB instance, you cannot access the cluster API server.

Select or clear **Expose API Server with EIP**. The ACK API server provides multiple HTTP-based RESTful APIs, which can be used to create, delete, modify, query, and monitor resources, such as pods and Services.

        -   If you select this check box, an elastic IP address \(EIP\) is created and associated with an Internet-facing SLB instance. Port 6443 used by the API server is opened on master nodes. You can connect to and manage the ACK cluster by using kubeconfig over the Internet.
        -   If you clear this check box, no EIP is created. You can connect to and manage the ACK cluster by using kubeconfig only within the VPC. |
        |**SSH Logon**|To enable Secure Shell \(SSH\) logon, you must first select **Expose API Server with EIP**.

        -   If you select Use SSH to Access the Cluster from the Internet, you can access the cluster by using SSH.
        -   If you clear Use SSH to Access the Cluster from the Internet, you cannot access the cluster by using SSH or kubectl. If you want to access an ECS instance in the cluster by using SSH, you must manually assign an EIP to the instance and configure security group rules to open SSH port 22. For more information, see [Use SSH to connect to an ACK cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Cluster/Access clusters/Use SSH to connect to an ACK cluster.md). |
        |**RDS Whitelist**|Set the Relational Database Service \(RDS\) whitelist. Add the IP addresses of the nodes in the cluster to the RDS whitelist.

**Note:** To enable an RDS instance to access the cluster, you must deploy the RDS instance in the VPC where the cluster is deployed. |
        |**Security Group**|You can select **Create Basic Security Group**, **Create Advanced Security Group**, or **Select Existing Security Group**. For more information, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Security/Security groups/Overview.md).

**Note:** To select **Select Existing Security Group**, [Submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/console.htm) to apply to be added to a whitelist. |

    2.  Configure advanced settings of the cluster.

        |Parameter|Description|
        |---------|-----------|
        |**Time Zone**|Select a time zone for the ACK cluster. By default, the time zone configured for your browser is selected. |
        |**Kube-proxy Mode**|iptables and IPVS are supported.

        -   iptables is a mature and stable kube-proxy mode. It uses iptables rules to conduct service discovery and load balancing. The performance of this mode is restricted by the size of the ACK cluster. This mode is suitable for ACK clusters that manage a small number of Services.
        -   IPVS is a high-performance kube-proxy mode. It uses Linux Virtual Server \(LVS\) to conduct service discovery and load balancing. This mode is suitable for ACK clusters that manage a large number of Services. We recommend that you use this mode in scenarios where high-performance load balancing is required. |
        |**Labels**|Add labels to the cluster. Enter a key and a value, and click **Add**.

**Note:**

        -   Key is required. Value is optional.
        -   Keys are not case-sensitive. A key must be 1 to 64 characters in length, and cannot start with aliyun, http://, or https://.
        -   Values are not case-sensitive. A value can be empty and can contain up to 128 characters in length. It cannot be http:// or https://.
        -   The keys of labels that are added to the same resource must be unique. If you add a label with a used key, the label overwrites the others that use the same key.
        -   If you add more than 20 labels to a resource, all labels become invalid. You must remove excess labels for the remaining labels to take effect. |
        |**Cluster Domain**|Set the domain name of the cluster.

**Note:** The default domain name is **cluster.local**. You can enter a custom domain name. A domain name consists of two parts. Each part must be 1 to 63 characters in length and can contain only letters and digits. You cannot leave these parts empty. |
        |**Custom Certificate SANs**|You can enter custom subject alternative names \(SANs\) for the API server certificate of the cluster to accept requests from specified IP addresses or domain names. |
        |**Service Account Token Volume Projection**|**Service account token volume projection** reduces security risks when pods use service accounts to access the API server. This feature enables kubelet to request and store the token on behalf of the pod. This feature also allows you to configure token properties, such as the audience and validity duration. For more information, see [Enable service account token volume projection](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Security management/Infrastructure security/Enable service account token volume projection.md). |
        |**Cluster CA**|If you select this check box, upload a Certificate Authority \(CA\) certificate for the ACK cluster to ensure secure data transmission between the server and client.|
        |**Deletion Protection**|Specify whether to enable deletion protection. Deletion protection prevents the cluster from being accidentally deleted in the console or by calling the API. This prevents user errors. |
        |**Resource Group**|The resource group that owns the cluster to be created. Each resource can belong to only one resource group. You can regard a resource group as a project, an application, or an organization based on your business scenarios. For more information, see [Resource groups](/intl.en-US/Tag & Resource/Resource/Resource groups.md). |

6.  Click **Next:Master Configurations** to configure master nodes.

    |Parameter|Description|

        |**Instance Type**|Select **ECS Bare Metal Instance**. Only ECS bare metal instances are supported.|
        |**Selected Types**|The selected instance type is displayed. You can select only ECS Bare Metal Instance as the instance type.|
        |**Quantity**|Specify the number of worker nodes \(ECS instances\) to be created. |
        |**System Disk**|**Enhanced SSDs**, **standard SSDs**, and **ultra disks** are supported.

**Note:**

        -   You can select **Enable Backup** to back up disk data.
        -   If you select **enhanced SSD** as the system disk type, you can set a custom **performance level** for the system disk.

You can select higher performance levels for enhanced SSDs with larger storage capacities. For example, you can select performance level 2 for an enhanced SSD with a storage capacity of more than 460 GiB. You can select performance level 3 for an enhanced SSD with a storage capacity of more than 1,260 GiB. For more information, see [Capacity and PLs](/intl.en-US/Block Storage/Block Storage overview/ESSDs.md). |
        |**Mount Data Disk**|**Enhanced SSDs**, **standard SSDs**, and **ultra disks** are supported. You can enable **disk encryption** and **disk backup** when you mount a data disk.

**Note:** The data disk is used to store the root file systems of all containers on the node. Therefore, you must mount a data disk of at least 200 GiB. We recommend that you mount a data disk of 1 TiB or more. |
        |**Operating System**|By default, the AliyunLinux operating system is used. You cannot change the operating system.|
        |**Logon Type**|        -   Key pair logon
            -   **Key Pair**: Select an SSH key pair from the drop-down list.
            -   **create a key pair**: Create an SSH key pair if none is available. For more information about how to create an SSH key pair, see [Create an SSH key pair](/intl.en-US/Security/Key pairs/Use an SSH key pair/Create an SSH key pair.md). After the key pair is created, set it as the credential that is used to log on to the cluster.
        -   Password logon
            -   **Password**: Enter the password that is used to log on to the nodes.
            -   **Confirm Password**: Enter the password again. |

    2.  Configure advanced settings of worker nodes.

        |Parameter|Description|
        |---------|-----------|
        |**Node Protection**|Specify whether to enable node protection.

**Note:** By default, this check box is selected. Node protection prevents nodes from being accidentally deleted in the console or by calling the API. This prevents user errors. |
        |**User Data**|For more information, see [Overview of ECS instance user data](/intl.en-US/Instance/Manage instance configurations/Manage instance user data/Overview of ECS instance user data.md). |
        |**Custom Node Name**|Specify whether to use a **custom node name**.

A node name consists of a prefix, an IP substring, and a suffix.

        -   Both the prefix and suffix can contain one or more parts that are separated by periods \(**.**\).These parts can contain lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens \(-\), and must start and end with a lowercase letter or digit.
        -   The IP substring length specifies the number of digits to be truncated from the end of the returned node IP address. Valid values: 5 to 12.
For example, if the node IP address is 192.1xx.x.xx, the prefix is aliyun.com, the IP substring length is 5, and the suffix is test, the node name will be aliyun.com00055test. |
        |**Node Port Range**|Set the node port range.|
        |**CPU Policy**|Set the CPU policy.

        -   none: This policy indicates that the default CPU affinity is used. This is the default policy.
        -   static: This policy allows pods with specific resource characteristics on the node to be granted with enhanced CPU affinity and exclusivity. |
        |**Taints**|Add taints to the worker nodes in the ACK cluster. |

8.  Click **Next:Component Configurations** to configure components.

    |Parameter|Description|
    |---------|-----------|
    |**Ingress**|Specify whether to install Ingress controllers. By default, **Install Ingress Controllers** is selected. For more information, see [Advanced Ingress configurations](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Network/Ingress management/Advanced Ingress configurations.md). |
    |**Volume Plug-in**|Select **CSI**. Only the Container Storage Interface \(CSI\) plug-in is supported by ACK clusters that run sandboxed containers. An ACK cluster can be automatically bound to Alibaba Cloud disks, Apsara File Storage NAS \(NAS\) file systems, and Object Storage Service \(OSS\) buckets that are mounted to pods in the cluster. For more information, see [Storage management-CSI](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Storage management-CSI/Storage overview.md).|
    |**Monitoring Agents**|Specify whether to install the CloudMonitor agent. By default, **Install CloudMonitor Agent on ECS Instance** and **Enable Prometheus Monitoring** are selected. After the CloudMonitor agent is installed on ECS nodes, you can view monitoring data about the nodes in the CloudMonitor console. |
    |**Log Service**|Specify whether to enable Log Service. You can select an existing Log Service project or create one. By default, **Enable Log Service** is selected. When you create an application, you can enable Log Service through a few steps. For more information, see [Collect log files from containers by using Log Service](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Observability/Log management/Collect log files from containers by using Log Service.md).

By default, **Install node-problem-detector and Create Event Center** is selected. You can also specify whether to **create Ingress dashboards** in the Log Service console. |
    |**Workflow Engine**|Specify whether to enable Alibaba Cloud Genomics Service \(AGS\).

**Note:** To use this feature, submit a ticket to apply to be added to a whitelist.

    -   If you select this check box, the system automatically installs the AGS workflow plug-in when the system creates the cluster.
    -   If you clear this check box, you must manually install the AGS workflow plug-in. For more information, see [Introduction to AGS CLI](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Genomics Service/AGS workflow/Introduction to AGS CLI.md). |
