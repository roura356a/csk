# Renew expiring Kubernetes cluster certificates

This topic describes how to renew Kubernetes cluster certificates that are about to expire. You can renew all certificates for a Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) cluster by clicking one button in the ACK console or by running a single command in a command-line interface \(CLI\). You can also renew the certificates for master and worker nodes separately.

-   An ACK cluster is created. For more information, see [Create a dedicated Kubernetes cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Cluster/Create Kubernetes clusters/Create a dedicated Kubernetes cluster.md) or [Create a managed Kubernetes cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Cluster/Create Kubernetes clusters/Create a managed Kubernetes cluster.md).

    **Note:** In managed Kubernetes clusters, ACK automatically renews the certificates for master nodes.

-   A kubectl client is connected to the cluster. For more information, see [Connect to Kubernetes clusters by using kubectl](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Cluster/Access clusters/Connect to ACK clusters by using kubectl.md).

## Renew the certificates for all nodes in the ACK console

1.  Log on to the [ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane of the ACK console, click **Clusters**.

3.  Select the cluster for which you want to renew the certificates and click **Update Certificate**. The Update Certificate message appears.

    **Note:** The Update Certificate button appears if the cluster certificate is about to expire in around two months.

4.  In the **Update Certificate** message, click **Update Certificate**.

5.  In the **Note** message, click **Confirm**.

    The following figure appears after the cluster certificates are renewed.

    -   In the Update Certificate message, **The certificate has been updated** appears.
    -   On the Clusters page, the **Update Certificate** button disappears.

## Renew the certificates for all nodes in a CLI

Log on to a master node of the cluster and run the following command to renew the certificates for all nodes:

```
curl http://aliacs-k8s-cn-hangzhou.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/public/cert-update/renew.sh | bash
```

Verify the result:

1.  Run the following command to query the master nodes and worker nodes in the cluster:

    ```
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    ![nodes](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/2635359951/p21600.png)

2.  Run the following command and verify that the value in the COMPLETIONS column of each master node is 1 and the value in the COMPLETIONS column of each worker node equals the number of worker nodes in the cluster. This indicates that all certificates are renewed.

    ```
    kubectl -n kube-system get job
    ```

## Manually renew the certificates for master nodes

1.  Create a file named job-master.yml in a random path and copy the following code to the file:

    ```
    apiVersion: batch/v1
    kind: Job
    metadata:
      name: ${jobname}
      namespace: kube-system
    spec:
      backoffLimit: 0
      completions: 1
      parallelism: 1
      template:
        spec:
          activeDeadlineSeconds: 3600
          affinity:
            nodeAffinity:
              requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
                nodeSelectorTerms:
                - matchExpressions:
                  - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
                    operator: In
                    values:
                    - ${hostname}
          containers:
          - command:
            - /renew/upgrade-k8s.sh
            - --role
            - master
            image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/cert-rotate:v1.0.0
            imagePullPolicy: Always
            name: ${jobname}
            securityContext:
              privileged: true
            volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /alicoud-k8s-host
              name: ${jobname}       
          hostNetwork: true
          hostPID: true
          restartPolicy: Never
          schedulerName: default-scheduler
          securityContext: null
          tolerations:
          - effect: NoSchedule
            key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
          volumes:
          - hostPath:
              path: /
              type: Directory
            name: ${jobname}
    ```

2.  Obtain the number of master nodes in the cluster and the hostname of each master node.

    -   Method 1: Use the CLI

        Run the following command:

        ```
        kubectl get nodes
        ```

        ![nodes](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/3635359951/p21548.png)

    -   Method 2: Use the console

        1.  Log on to the [ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com).
        2.  In the left-side navigation pane of the ACK console, click **Clusters**.
        3.  On the Clusters page, find the cluster that you want to manage and click the name or click **Details** in the **Actions** column.
        4.  In the left-side navigation pane of the cluster details page, choose **Nodes** \> **Nodes** to obtain the number of master nodes, and the name, IP address, and instance ID of each master node.
3.  Run the following command to set the $\{jobname\} and $\{hostname\} variables in the job-master.yml file:

    ```
    sed 's/${jobname}/cert-job-2/g; s/${hostname}/hostname/g' job-master.yml > job-master2.yml
    ```

    Where:

    -   $\{jobname\} is the name of the Job. In this example, cert-job-2 is used.
    -   $\{hostname\} is the name of the master node. In this example, hostname is set to a master node name that is obtained in Step 2.
4.  Run the following command to create the Job:

    ```
    kubectl create -f job-master2.yml
    ```

5.  Run the following command to query the Job. If the value in the COMPLETIONS column is 1, it indicates that the certificate of the master node is renewed.

    ```
    kubectl get job â€“nkube-system
    ```

6.  Repeat Steps 3 to 5 to renew the certificates for the other master nodes in the cluster.

## Manually renew the certificates for worker nodes

1.  Create a file named job-node.yml in a random path and copy the following code to the file:

    ```
    apiVersion: batch/v1
    kind: Job
    metadata:
      name: ${jobname}
      namespace: kube-system
    spec:
      backoffLimit: 0
      completions: ${nodesize}
      parallelism: ${nodesize}
      template:
        spec:
          activeDeadlineSeconds: 3600
          affinity:
            podAntiAffinity:
              requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
              - labelSelector:
                  matchExpressions:
                  - key: job-name
                    operator: In
                    values:
                    - ${jobname}
                topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
          containers:
          - command:
            - /renew/upgrade-k8s.sh
            - --role
            - node
            - --rootkey
            - ${key}
            image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/cert-rotate:v1.0.0
            imagePullPolicy: Always
            name: ${jobname}
            securityContext:
              privileged: true
            volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /alicoud-k8s-host
              name: ${jobname}
          hostNetwork: true
          hostPID: true
          restartPolicy: Never
          schedulerName: default-scheduler
          securityContext: null
          volumes:
          - hostPath:
              path: /
              type: Directory
            name: ${jobname}
    ```

    **Note:** If a worker node has a taint, you must add `tolerations` that match the taint in the job-node.yml file. To do this, add the following code between the `securityContext: {}` and `volumes:` section. If you have n worker nodes that have taints, add the following code n times.

    ```
          tolerations:
          - effect: NoSchedule
            key: ${key}
            operator: Equal
            value: ${value}
    ```

    To obtain the values of $\{name\} and $\{value\}, perform the following steps:

    1.  Create a file named taint.yml in a random path and copy the following code to the file:

        ```
        {{printf "%-50s %-12s\n" "Node" "Taint"}}
        {{- range .items}}
            {{- if $taint := (index .spec "taints") }}
                {{- .metadata.name }}{{ "\t" }}
                {{- range $taint }}
                    {{- .key }}={{ .value }}:{{ .effect }}{{ "\t" }}
                {{- end }}
                {{- "\n" }}
            {{- end}}
        {{- end}}
        ```

    2.  Run the following command to query the values of $\{name\} and $\{value\} for worker nodes that have taints:

        ```
        kubectl get nodes -o go-template-file="taint.tml"
        ```

        ![](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/3635359951/p21570.png)

2.  Run the following command to obtain the cluster Certificate Authority \(CA\) key:

    ```
    sed '1d' /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key | base64 -w 0
    ```

3.  Run the following command to set the $\{jobname\}, $\{nodesize\}, and $\{key\} variables in the job-node.yml file:

    ```
    sed 's/${jobname}/cert-node-2/g; s/${nodesize}/nodesize/g; s/${key}/key/g' job-node.yml > job-node2.yml
    ```

    Where:

    -   $\{jobname\} is the name of the Job. In this example, cert-node-2 is used.
    -   $\{nodesize\} is the number of worker nodes. For more information about how to obtain this value, see Step 1 in [Manually renew the certificates for worker nodes](#section_f3i_kk1_7dz). Replace nodesize with the actual value.
    -   $\{key\} is the cluster CA key. In this example, key is set to the CA key that is obtained in Step 2 of [Manually renew the certificates for worker nodes](#section_f3i_kk1_7dz).
4.  Run the following command to create the Job:

    ```
    kubectl create â€“f job-node2.yml
    ```

5.  Run the following command to query the Job. If the value in the COMPLETIONS column equals the number of worker nodes in the cluster, it indicates that the certificates of all worker nodes are renewed.

    ```
    kubectl get job â€“nkube-system
    ```
