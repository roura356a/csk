# Load-aware pod scheduling

Load-aware pod scheduling is a scheduling policy that can be used by Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) to monitor the loads on node resources based on the scheduling framework. When load-aware pod scheduling is enabled, the system reviews the historical statistics of loads on nodes. Then, the system schedules pods to nodes with lower loads to implement load balancing. This prevents applications or node crashes caused by an overloaded node.
