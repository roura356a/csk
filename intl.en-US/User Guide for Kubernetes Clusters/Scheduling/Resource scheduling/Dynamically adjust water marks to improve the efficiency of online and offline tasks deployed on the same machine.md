# Dynamically adjust water marks to improve the efficiency of online and offline tasks deployed on the same machine

In most cases, online and offline tasks are deployed on the same machine to make full use of the resources of the machine. The resource usage of different workloads varies by the time of day. You can dynamically adjust the resource usage and resource water marks of online and offline tasks to improve the performance efficiency of your workloads. This topic describes how to dynamically adjust water marks, use CronJobs, and enforce isolation policies to control the resource usage of tasks.

The resource-controller component is deployed. For more information, see [resource-controller](/intl.en-US/Release notes/System Component change Records/Other SQL statements/resource-controller.md).

In most cases, online and offline tasks are deployed on the same machine to make full use of the resources of the machine. Different workloads usually have different peak hours. The resource usage of the workloads varies by the time of day. For example, online tasks usually require more resources at daytime than at night.

You can dynamically adjust water marks to reduce the resource usage of offline tasks at daytime. You can control the resource water marks of offline tasks to ensure that online tasks have sufficient resources. At night, you can improve the resource usage and resource water marks of offline tasks. This allows offline tasks to make full use of idle resources and improve the overall resource utilization.

## Dynamically adjust water marks to control the resource usage of low-priority tasks

1.  Create a ConfigMap.

    1.  Create a file named resource-controller-config.yaml and copy the following code to the file:

        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: ConfigMap
        metadata:
          name: resource-controller-config
          namespace: kube-system
        data:
          default.qosClass: LS #LS (Latency Sensitive with High priority scheduling), BE (Best Effort with Low priority scheduling).
          default.cpushare.qos.low.cpu-watermark: "100" # 25, 50, and 100. Set maximum water mark of workload of low qos.
          default.cpushare.qos.low.namespaces: "besteffort-ns1, besteffort-ns2"" # By default NULL, suppress existing workload within specified namespaces immediately.
          default.cpushare.qos.high.force-reserved: "false" # By default false, true: turn on this switch to reserve dedicated CPUs for high priority tasks (LS).
        ```

        |Parameter|Description|
        |---------|-----------|
        |default.cpushare.qos.low.cpu-watermark|Specifies the maximum percentage of resources that can be occupied by low-priority tasks.|
        |default.cpushare.qos.low.namespaces|Specifies the namespace of the low-priority tasks that you want to control.|
        |default.cpushare.qos.high.force-reserved|Specifies whether to isolate high-priority tasks and low-priority tasks by scheduling the tasks to different CPUs. This parameter takes effect after the ConfigMap is created. For existing tasks, the parameter applies only to low-priority tasks. High-priority tasks are not affected. |

    2.  Run the following command to create a ConfigMap:

        ```
        kubectl create -f resource-controller-config.yaml
        ```

2.  Create an application.

    The following example shows how to create a low-priority task that calculates the value of Pi \(Ï€\). The `annotations` parameter is set.

    1.  Create a file named cal-pi.yaml and copy the following code to the file:

        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
          name: cal-pi
          annotations: 
            alibabacloud.com/qosClass: "BE" # The annotation specifies topology-aware CPU scheduling. 
        spec:
          restartPolicy: Never
          containers:
          - image: registry.cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/xianlu/java-pi
            name: cal-pi
            resources:
              requests:
                cpu: 4
              limits:
                cpu: 4  #Specify the value of resources.limit.cpu. 
            env:
            - name: limit
              value: "20000"
            - name: threadNum
              value: "3000"
        ```

    2.  Run the following command to create an application:

        ```
        kubectl create -f cal-pi.yaml
        ```


## Use CronJobs to control the resource usage of low-priority tasks by time

You can create a CronJob to configure the water marks of low-priority tasks. You can modify the `schedule` and `json` parameters to adjust the water marks of low-priority tasks by time. The schedule parameter specifies the task execution schedule. The json parameter specifies the resource configuration.

In this example, all low-priority BE tasks are allowed a maximum CPU usage of 25% starting from 07:00. This ensures that high-priority tasks have sufficient CPU resources.

1.  Create a file named mix-strategy-1.yaml and copy the following code to the file:

    ```
    apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
    kind: CronJob
    metadata:
      name: mix-strategy-1
      namespace: kube-system
    spec:
      schedule: "0 7 * * *"
      jobTemplate:
        spec:
          completions: 1
          parallelism: 1
          template:
            spec:
              containers:
                - args:
                  - $(JSON_INPUT)
                  env:
                  - name: JSON_INPUT
                    value:
                       '{
                        "apiVersion":"v1",
                        "kind":"ConfigMap",
                        "metadata":{
                          "name":"resource-controller-config",
                          "namespace":"kube-system"
                        },
                        "data":{
                          "default.cpushare.qos.high.force-reserved": "false",
                          "default.cpushare.qos.low.cpu-watermark":"25",
                          "default.qosClass":"LS",
                          "default.cpushare.qos.low.namespaces": "low-qos-workload-namespace"
                        }
                        }
                      '
                  name: strategy
                  command: ["change-config"]
                  image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/shuan****/change-config:v1
                  imagePullPolicy: Always
              serviceAccount: admin
              restartPolicy: OnFailure
    ```

2.  Run the following command to create a CronJob.

    ```
    kubectl create -f mix-strategy-1.yaml
    ```


Similarly, you can use CronJobs to control the water marks of other low-priority tasks at other time periods. This helps improve the overall resource utilization.

## Enforce isolation policies to control the resource usage of tasks

We recommend that you enforce isolation policies when the CPU usage of low-priority and high-priority tasks is both lower than 50%. You can set `default.cpushare.qos.high.force-reserved` to `true` and set `default.cpushare.qos.low.cpu-watermark` to 50. This isolates high-priority and low-priority tasks in different non-uniform memory access \(NUMA\) nodes and core complexes \(CCXes\), and provides a better performance environment for high-priority tasks.

1.  Modify the resource-controller-config.yaml file as shown in the following code block:

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: resource-controller-config
      namespace: kube-system
    data:
      default.qosClass: LS #LS (Latency Sensitive with High priority scheduling), BE (Best Effort with Low priority scheduling)
      default.cpushare.qos.low.cpu-watermark: "50" # 25, 50, and 100. Set maximum water mark of workload of low qos
      default.cpushare.qos.low.namespaces: "besteffort-ns1, besteffort-ns2"" # By default NULL, suppress existing workload within specified namespaces immediately.
      default.cpushare.qos.high.force-reserved: "true" # By default false, true: turn on this switch to reserve dedicated CPUs for high priority tasks (LS)
    ```

2.  Run the following command to modify the ConfigMap:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f resource-controller-config.yaml
    ```
