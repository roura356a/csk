SCC-based ACK clusters are applicable to high network throughput and compute-intensive scenarios.|All regions|[Create a dedicated Kubernetes cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Cluster/Create Kubernetes clusters/Create a dedicated Kubernetes cluster.md)|
|Auto scaling and cross-zone scheduling|Multiple scaling groups are supported for auto scaling. Cross-zone scheduling policies are supported. The auto scaling feature is optimized. You can configure multiple scaling groups so that resources of different specifications are automatically added when the scaling threshold is reached. This feature meets the requirements of running compute-intensive applications and GPU computing tasks. When you configure auto scaling policies, you can specify different scheduling policies for multiple zones, including priority policies, cost optimization policies, and zone balancing policies. This meets the requirement for resource scheduling when the cluster is deployed across multiple zones.|All regions|[Auto scaling of nodes](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Auto Scaling/Auto scaling of nodes.md)|
|Custom cluster domain names|Custom cluster domain names are supported. ACK allows you to customize a cluster domain name by specifying the cluster-domain parameter. The cluster-domain parameter specifies the local domain name that is used for service discovery. If you have multiple clusters, we recommend that you customize the local domain names to simplify the management of clusters and services. ACK allows you to customize a cluster domain name when you create a cluster. This simplifies management and improves the O&M efficiency.|All regions|[Create a dedicated Kubernetes cluster](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Cluster/Create Kubernetes clusters/Create a dedicated Kubernetes cluster.md)|
|App Hub|App Hub is provided in App Catalog. App Hub provides various cloud-native and open source containerized applications. ACK integrates App Hub into App Catalog.

This saves you the inconvenience of creating clusters and deploying applications by using a CLI.|All regions|[View the application catalog](/intl.en-US/User Guide for Kubernetes Clusters/Application marketplace/App catalog management/View the application catalog.md)|
|Cloud controller manager|The cloud controller manager is upgraded. The cloud controller manager is the core component in an ACK cluster and is responsible for managing various cloud resources, such as SLB instances and VPCs. The following features are added to the cloud controller manager:-   SLB instances can be created with access control settings. You can specify an IP whitelist for an SLB instance that is created by ACK. This enhances the security of the ACK cluster.
-   You can specify whether to remove unschedulable nodes when you run the kubectl cordon or kubectl drain command. Cordoning and draining nodes are important features in cluster maintenance. However, the community has not reached an agreement on whether to remove a node from the backend of an SLB instance when the node is set to unschedulable for maintenance. The cloud controller manager provides an interface that allows you to specify whether to remove such nodes from the backend of the SLB instance. This ensures the flexibility of maintenance.
-   Pods can be mounted to the backend of an SLB instance by using Terway. Terway ENI is the latest network plug-in that is provided by ACK. The core feature of Terway ENI is to mount the ENI IP address of a node to a pod. The cloud controller manager allows you to mount pods instead of nodes to the backend of an SLB instance. This prevents traffic forwarding through nodes and improves network performance.
-   Node weights can be set based on the number of pods on each node for Services in Local mode. The cloud controller manager can adjust the percentage of traffic that is sent to each node based on the number of pods on each node. This balances workloads among nodes. This feature applies to only Services in Local mode.
