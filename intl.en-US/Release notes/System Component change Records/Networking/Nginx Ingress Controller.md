# Nginx Ingress Controller

This topic introduces Ingresses and describes how Ingresses work. It also lists the latest changes to the NGINX Ingress controller.

## Introduction

**Introduction to Ingress**

In a Kubernetes cluster, an Ingress functions as an access point that exposes Services in the cluster. It distributes most of the network traffic that is destined for the Services in the cluster. An Ingress is a Kubernetes resource. It manages external access to the Services in a Kubernetes cluster. You can configure forwarding rules for an Ingress to route network traffic to backend pods of different Services.

**How an Ingress controller works**

To ensure that the Ingress resource in a cluster works as expected, you must deploy an Ingress controller in the cluster to parse the Ingress rules. After an Ingress controller receives a request that matches an Ingress rule, the request is routed to the corresponding Service. Then, the Service forwards the request to pods and the pods process the request. In a Kubernetes cluster, Services, Ingresses, and Ingress controllers work in the following process:

-   A Service is an abstraction of an application that is deployed on a set of replicated pods.
-   An Ingress contains reverse proxy rules. It controls to which Services HTTP or HTTPS requests are routed. For example, an Ingress routes requests to different Services based on the hosts and URLs in the requests.
-   An Ingress controller is a reverse proxy program that parses Ingress rules. If changes are made to the Ingress rules, the Ingress controller updates the Ingress rules accordingly. After an Ingress controller receives a request, it redirects the request to a Service based on the Ingress rules.
